Interactive site quiz (prototype)
----------------------------------
This repository includes a small interactive, client-side quiz prototype implemented with JSON, vanilla JavaScript and CSS. The quiz data is in `quizzes/test_your_knowledge.json`. To preview locally, install Quarto and run `quarto preview` at the repo root, or open the built `docs` or `_site` directory in a web server. The quiz script is `scripts/quiz.js`; to add a quiz to a page, add the placeholder and script include (see `quizzes/README.md`).
